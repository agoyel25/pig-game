# PIG-Game 🎊 🎊 🎈


## GAME RULES 🤩⭐

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 20 points on GLOBAL score wins the game





## Features to implement 💡🤔
- [ ] If the user clicks on hold by mistake before rolling the dice then the games would alert the player of the error and have a chance to roll the dice.
- [ ] Laderboard where the overall best player would be displayed in the page for Scores.
